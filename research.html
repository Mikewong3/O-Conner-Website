            Chronic leg and foot ulcers heal considerably slowly, lasting on average 12 to 13 months and are commonly associated with systemic diseases and conditions with impaired wound healing such as diabetes and vascular disease. For example, diabetic leg ulcers are an example of a difficult to heal chronic wound associated with diabetes and venous leg ulcers are a chronic wound attributed to poor blood circulation. A hallmark of these chronic wounds is out of balance inflammation caused by elevated levels of proteases, reactive oxidative species (ROS) and instances of infection. We are developing hydrogels that target multiple aspects of a toxic inflammatory process. These hydrogels are being designed to counteract the high levels of ROS, proteolytic activity and microbial infection in chronic wounds. Hydrogels comprised of polydopamine and polyethylene imine (PEI) will be developed to impart both antioxidant and antimicrobial activity.

            Curcumin is a widely researched and utilized natural product used for a variety of ailments including as a gastrointestinal aide and an anticancer agent. Curcumin however suffers from poor bioavailability. A strategy to circumvent poor bioavailability is to administer with an adjuvant or by synthetic modification. We have incorporated curcumin into a self-degradable polymer by condensation with N,N′-di-Boc-L-cystine. The polymer is made self-degradable upon deprotection of the cystine amines. The polymeric curcumin retains its anti-cancer activity within the polymer showing activity against HT29 human colon cancer cells and DU-145 prostate cancer cells.
